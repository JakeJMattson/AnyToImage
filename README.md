This project allows you to convert almost any file, group of files, or directory into an image.
By reading bytes from a file and using those bytes as color channel values, pixels can be constructed and used to form an image.
The current build allows you to convert files to images, and extract files from converted images.

The files can be obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world">hello-world repository</a>
which was inspired by <a href="https://helloworldcollection.github.io/">The Hello World Collection</a>.
